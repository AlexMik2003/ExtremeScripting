#ExtremeXOS InSite

## Introduction
ExtremeXOS&trade; InSite is a software development kit (SDK) that extends the capabilities of ExtremeXOS through a set of comprehensive application programming interfaces (APIs). These interfaces augment the networking power of ExtremeXOS by allowing applications the ability to interface directly with Extreme Networks&reg; switches.

The APIs enable reliable and secure external device-to-device management communication. They provide a mechanism to communicate with ExtremeXOS switches using XML messages. The standards-based SOAP/XML architecture of ExtremeXOS InSite makes it easy to integrate the network infrastructure with higher-level application and business software. The configuration and monitoring capabilities provided by the APIs let you create Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) solutions that bridge the gap between application and business logic with network configuration and events.

## SDK Contents
