# check_eaps
This script runs from a server/PC with python installed and check the eaps config and status of one or more switches

### Description
This script will telnet to every switch IP given in the file when used with -f or checks only 1 switch when used with -s.
It will check the eaps config if all vlans are added correctly to the ring ports and will also check if there are vlans added 
to the ring ports that are not protected by eaps that could possibly cause loops.
